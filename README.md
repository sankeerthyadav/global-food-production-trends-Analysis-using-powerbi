# 🌾 Global Food Production Analysis — Power BI Project

## 📘 Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes **global food production data** sourced from the **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)** through **Kaggle**.
The aim is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights into agricultural production across countries and regions.
The project involves **data preprocessing, cleaning, transformation, visualization**, and **insight generation**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze worldwide food production trends over time.
* Identify top-producing countries and regions.
* Examine crop-wise production distribution.
* Measure **Year-over-Year (YoY)** growth in production.
* Build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for easy data exploration and insights.

---

## 🧾 Dataset Information

**Source:** [Kaggle - FAO Food Production Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
**Description:** The dataset contains yearly food production data (in tonnes) for multiple crops, countries, and regions.
**Key Columns:**

* `Entity` – Country or region name
* `Code` – Country/Region code
* `Year` – Year of observation
* `Production (tonnes)` – Crop production volume
* `Item` – Type of crop or food item

## 🧹 Data Preparation Steps

The dataset was cleaned and transformed using **Power Query** and **Power BI**:

| Step                           | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data Overview**              | Reviewed dataset structure and key fields.                                           |
| **Data Cleaning**              | Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and corrected data inconsistencies.      |
| **Data Transformation**        | Used Power Query to **unpivot columns**, filter years, and create calculated fields. |
| **Data Type Conversion**       | Converted year and numerical columns to proper datatypes.                            |
| **Column Splitting & Merging** | Combined or separated data fields as needed.                                         |
| **Saved Processed Data**       | Stored clean and structured data for visualization.                                  |
